## Requirements and Usage

The script runs on the Python stack and requires the following packages: 

    pandas
    re

The script helps to generate the input prompt that is then given to GPT-4 via the interface on https://chat.openai.com. 

The script contains three main functions (*Add description about what the different variables mean*):

1. ```extract_info(pattern, text)```: This function uses regex patterns to extract specific parts of information from an output generated by GPT-4.

2. ```append_information(df, output_text, choice, human_feedback)```: This function is used to append new information into a Pandas DataFrame based on the user's chosen task and their feedback. It also constructs the next AI prompt for the user. 

3. ```generate_long_term_memory(df)```: This function generates a long-term memory prompt string that includes stage-wise summaries.

## Data

The data used in the interactive prompting strategy at each step of the process is given in the [Excel Sheet](./data/prompt-input-and-GPT-4-output.xlsx) present in  the [data](./data/) folder. The Excel Sheet has the following headers:


| MOF |	Summary |	Iteration |	Status Evaluation |	Choice 1 |	Choice 2 |	Choice 3 |	Choice Selected |	Human Feedback |	Next Prompt |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |


*Add more details about what the different columns mean, etc. (which columns correspond to the output from GPT and which ones correspond to the input provided to GPT)*

The input prompt generation script is distributed under the MIT open source license (see [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt))
